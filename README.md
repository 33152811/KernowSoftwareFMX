Kernow Software FMX Components

Firemonkey Slide menu for Delphi.  Inherits from a non-visual component to keep things simple.

Includes demo showing a right and left aligned slider menu.

- set menu background colour
- set selected item colour
- set font colours
- add images to items
- fade background
- left or right aligned menus
- non-visual component for quick integration into existing projects
- uses bitmap caching for optimised performance

Just the one component at the moment but hopefully I'll add more soon.


Any suggestions for updates are welcome :-)
