# KernowSoftwareFMX
Kernow Software FMX Components for XE7 & XE8. 

(May work with earlier versions but untested)

Firemonkey Slide menu, ListView and Segment buttons for Delphi.  Inherits from a non-visual component to keep things simple.

Includes demo.

TksListview

- set menu background colour
- set selected item colour
- set font colours
- add images to items
- fade background
- left or right aligned menus
- non-visual component for quick integration into existing projects
- uses bitmap caching for optimised performance

Just the one component at the moment but hopefully I'll add more soon.


Any suggestions for updates are welcome :-)
